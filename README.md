# KUATO CLI

Repo for the Kuato command line script, formatted for publishing as an npm module.

`npm install -g kuato`

This package installs the command line script for kuato, which builds a grunt-based static site scaffold. See https://github.com/cemckinley/kuato for scaffold repo and usage.

Node, npm, compass, and grunt-cli need be installed at the global (command line) level to use kuato. NOTE: kuato is built based on the latest grunt 0.4.x release. You should have installed grunt-cli already, and a local copy of grunt will be added to a project you create using kuato. See https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki/Getting-started for more info on getting started with grunt.
